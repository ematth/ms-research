	abstract = {The recognition of patterns that have a time dependency is common in areas like speech recognition or natural language processing. The equivalent situation in image analysis is present in tasks like text or video recognition. Recently, Convolutional Recurrent Neural Networks (CRNN) have been broadly applied to solve these tasks in an end-to-end fashion with successful performance. However, its application to Optical Music Recognition (OMR) is not so straightforward due to the presence of different elements sharing the same horizontal position, disrupting the linear flow of the timeline. In this paper, we study the ability of the state-of-the-art CRNN approach to learn codes that represent this disruption in homophonic scores. In our experiments, we study the lower bounds in the recognition task of real scores when the models are trained with synthetic data. Two relevant conclusions are drawn: (1) Our serialized ways of encoding the music content are appropriate for CRNN-based OMR; (2) the learning process is possible with synthetic data, but there exists a glass ceiling when recognizing real sheet music.},

@article{contreras2023omrpiano,
	abstract = {End-to-end solutions have brought about significant advances in the field of Optical Music Recognition. These approaches directly provide the symbolic representation of a given image of a musical score. Despite this, several documents, such as pianoform musical scores, cannot yet benefit from these solutions since their structural complexity does not allow their effective transcription. This paper presents a neural method whose objective is to transcribe these musical scores in an end-to-end fashion. We also introduce the GrandStaff dataset, which contains 53,882 single-system piano scores in common western modern notation. The sources are encoded in both a standard digital music representation and its adaptation for current transcription technologies. The method proposed in this paper is trained and evaluated using this dataset. The results show that the approach presented is, for the first time, able to effectively transcribe pianoform notation in an end-to-end manner.},
